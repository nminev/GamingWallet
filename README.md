# GamingWallet

The wallet is the heart of the gaming experience and as such, it needs to provide
the following features:
	● In the beginning, the player starts with a balance of $0 and after every
	operation, their new balance is displayed
	● Money deposit - the player must be able to deposit funds
	● Money withdrawal - the player must be able to withdraw funds
	● Placing bets & accepting wins - the player must be able to play a simple
	game that simulates a real slot game (see game rules below)
	● Game rules - our game of chance provides a simple betting experience with
	the following rules:
		○ The game accepts bets between $1 and $10
		○ The game plays out as follows:
			■ 50% of the bets lose
			■ 40% of the bets win up to x2 the bet amount
			■ 10% of the bets win between x2 and x10 the bet amount
		○ After every round the player balance is calculated as follows:
		{new balance} = {old balance} - {bet amount} + {win amount}
	● The game ends when the player decides to leave

Important note:
All operations that require an amount must include the amount as a positive
number, regardless of the direction of the balance.
